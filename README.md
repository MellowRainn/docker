Preventing Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) with Laravel Breeze

In my Laravel application, I have taken steps to prevent Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerabilities. The following measures have been implemented:
Access Control Middleware

To mitigate IDOR risks, I applied the necessary access control middleware provided by Laravel. Specifically, I utilized the built-in auth middleware to enforce access restrictions to routes and controllers that involve sensitive resources. This middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access the edit user profile functionality.

By applying the auth middleware to the relevant routes or controllers, I guarantee that unauthorized users cannot manipulate or access other users' profiles, thereby preventing IDOR vulnerabilities.

To experience the prevention of IDOR in action, follow these steps:

    Visit the hosted application at [URL{https://laradock.azurewebsites.net/].
    Create a new user account or log in using existing credentials.
    After authentication, navigate to the user profile editing page.
    Observe that only the authenticated user can modify their own profile, while attempting to edit another user's profile will result in an appropriate error message or access denial.
    This exemplifies the successful implementation of access control middleware, safeguarding against IDOR vulnerabilities.
